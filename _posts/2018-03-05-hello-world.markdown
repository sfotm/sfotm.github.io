Not the most original post title, but I guess it gets the point across.

I've decided to move my online presence to this website to get myself writing and contributing back to FOSS communities. Sometimes I'll figure something out in Godot, or finally get a driver working, and I'd like to be able to share it somewhere where I feel like it can be preserved and help somebody else out. I already had a github pages site going, so it made good sense to put it all here.

I'd also like an area where I can share everything I like to without surrendering control of it. I'm not particularly averse to social media as a whole, but I get warm fuzzies when I'm self-hosting everything I can (and it keeps me busy).

Cheers. :beers:
