A reverse-chronological list of the books I've read. Longer reviews will take the form of separate posts, theoretically speaking. Updated at the end of every month (or so help me).

Here's the rating scale as I see it:

| Rating                      | Reasoning |
| ---------------------------| ------ |
| 1/5 | No real reason to read - not entertaining or informative. |
| 2/5 | Has merit, but has serious flaws in narrative or focus.
| 3/5 | Worth a read, but not something I feel you're seriously missing out on. |
| 4/5 | A very good book, and a recommendation I'd eagerly hand out. |
| 5/5 | A very good book that also holds some uniqueness that makes it especially worth reading. It has a unique perspective not easily found in other books. |

Note that I came up with the above in September 2020, so my earlier ratings may not reflect it exactly. For example, I think *Catcher in the Rye* probably deserves a 5/5 given the above scale, whereas *It* would probably be downgraded to a 4/5, as it's essentially a *very very good* execution on the Stephen King horror genre while not separating from the group entirely.

| Greenlights | Matthew McConaughey | 3/5 |
| Anxious People | Fredrik Backman | 1/5 |
| The Picture of Dorian Gray | Oscar Wilde | 4/5 |

**Greenlights** isn't a book that I would have picked up if it hadn't been recommended to me. I have the impression that releasing a book is just something that someone does once they hit a certain level of celebrity. You have a built in audience for the book, ghostwriters probably don't make all that much, and it creates a little more legacy, so the figures look good enough for someone to get the process rolling. 

Greenlights is written by Mr. McCanaughey himself, though. I took that as a good sign, thinking it would feel more authentic. It also had the benefit of being read by its author on the Audible store - I didn't know what his writing was like, but I knew he could deliver lines pretty well. It also meant that I didn't have to spend productive time reading it.

I don't know if I took much away from it, but it was entertaining, especially when it came to the stories he had from childhood. Worth a listen, but maybe not a read.

**Anxious People** is a work of fiction that starts off pretty promising. It kicks off as a crime thriller - a bank robbery has taken place, and hostages have been taken. The stage is set and stakes are high. The shuffled chronology of the story is like a Tarantino movie, and I like what it promises: a fresh take on a hostage drama. Perhaps the title refers to some sort of [tactical empathy](https://blog.blackswanltd.com/the-edge/how-to-use-fbi-empathy) used by a hostage negotiator to talk the robber down. Maybe we learn the robbery was justified in a sort of twist. The book has a lot going for it after the setup.

...and then everything goes south. Some of it is personal, and some of it is just bad narrative.

1. _The witness interviews are borderline insufferable._ They're peppered in between chapters detailing the actual hostage event to add, I think, additional color, character development, and because they're generally a fun way to shake up the format a little bit. They're a trope for a reason. In this book, though, they're mostly just an opportunity for the interviewees to act like they're auditioning for the cast of **Mean Girls** and to berate the people who are trying to resolve what happened to the bank robber who seemingly took them as hostages under the threat of violence. Even besides that, the punchy back-and-forth dialogue the author is going for just doesn't ring true.

Here's an outtake from one of the interviews. Jim is an investigator, and Zara is a senior bank executive that was taken hostage at a house showing:

> JIM: I feel stupid now.

> ZARA: I don't suppose that's a new feeling for you.

> JIM: If I'd known you ran a bank, obviously I wouldn't have said that. Well, I mean, I shouldn't have said it anyway. I'm not really sure what to say now.

> ZARA: In that case, perhaps I can just leave?

> JIM: No, hold on. Look, this is all a bit embarrassing. My wife has often told me that I should just keep my mouth shut. I'll stick to my questions from now on, okay?

> ZARA: Let's give it a try.

I wish I could say that this interview was uniquely bad and that it could be ascribed to two bad individual characters, but it's not. All of the witness interviews have the same uncharming rhythm and rapport. The "men-are-kind-of-stupid-and-unenlightened" sentiment that's pushed at some points in the book isn't something I appreciate, either, but that's beside the point.

2. _There's no real risk of things going south._ The story pulls you in with the premise of a high-stakes bank robbery, and then reneges on it: now you learn that the story isn't so much about the robber - it's about the people in the hostage situation and how they interact with each other. The hostage taker is shown pretty early on to be harmless, and even open to taking suggestions on how to resolve the situation from the "hostages" they've taken. At that point, you basically have two well-meaning but confused cops trying to figure out what the hell happened to the robber that's turned into a protagonist. At this point, there's no longer any conflict, and you're either continuing to read because you're a completionist held hostage (the irony!), or because you've grown attached to the characters (which seems a lot less likely given point 3).

3. _The author has almost no unique voice in this book._ The setup and premise start off as promising, but as the book increasingly leans on the characters to carry the story on through dialogue without any compelling action taking place, it falls apart because none of the characters have anything interesting to say. It reminds me of a Tom Segura bit I like:

> I feel like… the worst part, honestly, of traveling in our country is that there’s no surprises. I swear to you, I travel every week, and it’s really a disappointment. Every place is exactly what I thought it was going to be. You know? I can prove it to you. Picture a place you’ve never been to in this country. Picture it. That’s exactly how it is. [laughter] What are the people like, you wonder? What do you think they’re like? That’s right.

Picture a conversation between a repressed middle-aged mother and a young newer-fashioned woman about to have her first child as written by a left-leaning author. Picture it. That's exactly how it is. Imagine the subject matter those conversations would cover, and how these people might grate against each other, and which one is seen in favorable light. Imagine it. That's right. Repeat for all of the other interactions, which, again, are the main focus of the book.

This designed-by-committee feel touches a lot of things in this book, and it feels as though Backman doesn't have a lot of himself in it. If the author isn't willing to show up for the story, why should readers?

**The Picture of Dorian Gray** went unexpectedly well for me. I went into it feeling as though I signed up for an adventure that took place in the world of **Pride and Prejudice**, a book that I failed to read to completion in high school, partially because I didn't enjoy reading as much as I do now, and partially because I found it all rather hard to relate to. To wit, I didn't have high expectations for this book, even though I expected it to be well-written and meaningful on some level.

Instead, it was a great read - I don't want to spoil much of this book because it goes in unexpected directions, espescially at first. Essentially, it becomes the story of a man wrestling with the well-being of his soul.

| A Farewell to Arms | Earnest Hemingway | 4/5 |
| Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine | Gail Honeyman | 3/5 |
| The Bell Jar | Sylvia Plath | 4/5 |

Both **A Farewell to Arms** and **The Bell Jar** are semi-autobiographical - I had no idea about that going in, but enjoyed them both.

**A Farewell to Arms** is a really approachable novel that starts off in Italy during World War One. It starts off feeling a little like a less-absurd **Catch 22**, focusing on the ambivalence of soliders in a war they don't want to participate in, but moves in a different direction as the plot moves forward. Hemingway doesn't use very flowery words, but manages to paint a pretty picture anyway. Ever since I've read this, I've been trying to make what I write at work and in life a little more plain, too.

I thought **Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine** was going to be a female analogue to **The Rosie Project**. It started off in that direction, but it ended up deviating from that expectation quite a bit. Some of the plot points intended to be surprising were somewhat obvious, but it was still plenty enjoyable.

**The Bell Jar** is interesting in that it follows the crack-up of Sylvia Plath during her college years. Though it's not entirely true to life, it is semi-autobiographical. There are letters from Plath's mother discouraging the publishing of the novel, saying that it could stand to hurt some people that are only thinly disguised within the novel.

The title refers to a sensation that Esther Greenwood increasingly feels - that she's become captive within herself, breathing air within a bell jar that's descended upon her. After a few close encounters with death, she finds help and manages to lift that jar (notably with the help of electroconvulsive therapy, which I've learned is still used for treatment-resistant cases). But the ending is bittersweet - you never know when that glass cage might come back down.

This book actually came onto my books to read list when I realized that a quote I really like came from it. It was used in the TV series **Master of None**, which is where I first heard it. I thought it was from **The Kite Runner** for the longest time, but it turns out the two fig trees have nothing to do with each other. Here's the quote:

> I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.

I'm not a frequent reader of poetry, but Plath has a way with words without needing to pull out the flowery ones. Maybe I'll pick up a collection of hers sometime.

| Cold Sassy Tree | Olive Ann Burns | 3/5 |

**Cold Sassy Tree** is a slice-of-life novel that follows a boy named Will Tweedy in early 20th Century Georgia. A lot of the focus is on his grandfather, Mr. E Rucker Blakeslee, as he continuously defies societal expectations. It doesn't cling to themes (individualism is the strongest, I think) or pander, it's just sort of a sequence of events that happens.

| Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban | J.K. Rowling | 3/5 |
| The Grapes of Wrath | John Steinbeck | 5/5 |
| Of Mice and Men | John Steinbeck | 4/5 |

**Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban** seems like the taking-off point for the series in some ways, but I'd guess it's more similar to the installments before it than to the ones after it. If you've seen the movies, you know that things really kick into a higher gear once you hit year four: things stop getting wrapped into a nice little bow, and the novels no longer stand on their own. PoA introduces some darker themes, but still works as a standalone adventure, as the events within the book don't really carry on past it. Obviously Sirius Black is introduced as a character, but he could have just as easily not have been in prison in the first place. Admittedly, that would make his character a lot less interesting.

Really looking forward to the next few, it's a nice way to have a break between denser books.

**The Grapes of Wrath** might be my book of the year. It follows the migration of a family from the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression. They head toward California with the impression that there's work to be had there, high-paying work that would set a family up to be well-fed and landed. When they arrive, already having survived a difficult journey, they find out that the West is not what they expected.

The novel faced some hard times when it first came out, and was burned in some cases. It lambasts the Farmer's Association that was in power in California at the time for treating immigrants very poorly, enstating wage caps and actively disrupting attempts at unionization.

Simultaneously, if Steinbeck is credible, some fields remain untouched because they fruit they've bourne can't be turned for a profit at any labor costs, and so it's left to wither there; it cannot be given away for free, as you can't sell an orange for ten cents at the grocery if you're giving them away for free by the bushel in a nearby field. Therein, Steinbeck argued, is a systemic failure - the crop disappears as hundreds of families starve some number of miles away.

And so the largest argument being made, by far, is that unfettered capitalism doesn't serve a society well if you'd say that people starving to death is an undesirable thing to have happening in a society (I'd agree with that). Of course, America has a mixed economy like just about any nation, and we've introduced some number of social programs since then that seem to have raised the floor away from having to drive from town to town for work that exploits your situation so that your kids don't starve.

There are other themes at play that I found interesting to think about: 
* The loss of an identity that happened when these farmers left their land
* The dissolution of the family unit
* Perserverance through hardships
  * The Joads were poor and flat broke, but they never gave out, and as cheesy as that sounds, I think it's important. You can't ascribe their situation to poor work ethic or resentment.

Self-policing communities also come up positively in the book (i.e. deputies are in the pockets of the Farmer's Association, so nobody wanted them involved in the Hoovervilles or other camps if it could be helped), which is interesting given where social attentions are at right now.

As for the writing style, I'm all about American colloquialisms and country accents, so when "Rose of Sharon is going to have a baby" gets translated to "Rosasharn's in a fambly kinda way", or someone says "Ain't no pork without a shoat", I'm all about it. The scenes are easy to follow and it reads pretty easily - you don't need to go diving for the core message of the book. Intercalary segments frame the trip of a family within the bigger picture: hundreds of families moving West, all at once, many suffering. It's a good literary device for what's being conveyed, and they break up the dialogue and action nicely.

**Of Mice and Men** is sort of "Grapes of Wrath Light". It holds a lot of the same themes, but is a lot shorter and has a more colorful cast of characters. You can read the thing in an afternoon, and even though it's not as thematically dense as Grapes of Wrath, it's a lot more efficient in saying what it wants to say. Really hard to go wrong here.

| Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone | J.K. Rowling | 3/5 |
| Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets | J.K. Rowling | 3/5 |
| The Good Earth | Pearl S. Buck | 5/5 |

**The Harry Potter Series** is a really well executed run of fantasy novels, and this is my first time going through them all. Growing up watching the movies, I'd always heard from readers-turned-watchers that there were plot points missing from the movies entirely, quotes reassigned to different roles, and scenes invented for the sake of the film adaptation. All of that is true, and it's going to become increasingly evident, I've been told, the further I go into the series.

I'd say my favorite bit of the books I've read that are unique to the books would be the character introduction for Vernon Dursley. The movie doesn't capture his love for drills at all.

**The Good Earth** earns a 5/5 for its dive into early 20th Century Chinese culture. It follows Wang Lung, born a poor farmer's boy, from his early adulthood up until his death, detailing a lifestyle completely foreign to me; the novel begins with him retrieving his never-before-seen wife-to-be, a slave purchased by his father, from her master's palace.

It's difficult to root for Wang at times. He hurts and endangers people close to him in ways that are reprehensible by modern standards. At the same time, he's an intensely moral person - he's just playing by a different rule book. It's an interesting thought exercise to think about the things that Wang does (and we do) just to belong to a part of larger society, and how much a person's life and personality can vary based on the time and place they inhabit.

| The Stand | Stephen King | 3/5 |

**The Stand** was pitched to me as one of Stephen King's most popular books. Generally speaking, constant readers of King either like *It* or *The Stand* the most. Neither of these are King's own favorite - that title goes to *Lisey's Story*, a book I have not read.

The book starts off strongly with a pretty wide cast of characters. There's Franny Goldsmith, Stuart Redman, a newly hired deaf-mute deputy, some guys on an army base, a mentally deranged arsonist that goes by "Trashcan Man", and even more where that came from. It's a pretty large ensemble of varied characters that lovers of *It* would probably take as a good sign, since *It* did a really good job of taking sets of disjoint characters and throwing them all into a ring together.

That's why this book fell a little flat for me - the characters, so good alone, were never built into something that was better than the sum of their parts, or even equal to it. Characters that were much stronger on their own, such as Fran and Stuart, were both less interesting once they met. Stuart went from being a stoic man of quiet strength to being a stock male character that acted predictably. Fran went from being an independent woman that was going to carve her own way in the world to becoming a doting wife. I'm not saying that the characters act irrationally, or that there's anything wrong with the people they become in principle. It just means they're not terribly interesting to listen to, even if they're endangering their life or acting selflessly. It's especially disappointing since the characters had real promise earlier on in the book. *It* did not have this problem - to my recollection, every character had a solid trajectory throughout the span of that book.

Pretty disappointed in how the R.F. side of the story concluded, too. Stephen King knows how to write a villain cloaked in shadow *very* well. He shares terrifying details that scare you while simultaneously making you want more. When the story starts asking how this character might meet it's demise, though, Stephen King draws a serious blank. This was actually one of the better villain endings he's written (not as good as *It*'s), but it's still a disappointment. R.F.'s defeat isn't surprising or all that interesting, but the character himself *was*. That disparity is why I feel disappointed.

Overly long with some disappointing characters. Worth a read, but if you're looking for my favorite Stephen King book, this isn't it. He's written better stories in fewer pages.

## May

Listen, **The Stand** is a long book. Such a long book. Then, Stephen King said, "Hey, you know that long book I wrote? Yeah, let's make it longer and publish it again."

Also Reading **Black Wave**, but not commenting on it until I finish. It's a hard read given how unfamiliar I am with ~~Middle-Eastern names, geography, culture, history~~ the Middle-East.

| Never Split the Difference | Chris Voss | 4/5 |

**Never Split the Difference** is a practical book on negotiation told by a man that has experience in high-stake negotiations where lives hang in the balance. It's a little odd to take that one-line summary at first glance and come away convinced that this will help you in negotiating mundane things that are a part of your every day life, like rent or a paycheck.

The book is interesting in that it doesn't focus on game theory or intellectual arguments much at all. The keystone of the methods put forward by Voss is actually emotional intelligence (Voss coins the phrase "tactical empathy", which is actually kind of hilarious). He thinks that what his experience has taught him most is that a lot of kidnappers, bank robbers, and other would-be action movie characters don't barter using strong logic, not exclusively anyway, and neither does the average person on the street.

He encourages empathizing with the people you're negotiating with, to call them generous and to keep your "late night FM DJ" voice on at all times. Ask open-ended questions and make them solve your problems ("How am I supposed to pay $X for this when this less expensive alternative is right in front of me?", "How am I supposed to do that?") while being as earnest, calm, and reasonable as you can manage to be - you and your counterpart are working together toward a solution. It's a pretty moral system if you approach it with the right mindset, or a pretty amoral one if you're a sociopath (sort of like "How to Win Friends and Influence People").

| Why We Sleep | Matthew Walker, PhD | 3/5 |

**Why We Sleep** probably isn't a book you should bother reading cover-to-cover. Really, if you already know that sleep is good for you and that missing sleep is bad, you can probably do without it entirely. There's some interesting trivia about the stages of sleep and how its qualities might change from, say, childhood to adulthood, but nothing revolutionary. If you don't value sleep, this book might work as a "scared straight" sort of experience, because it turns out that this neuroscientist is pretty confident that missing sleep'll mess you up.

There were 12 tips in the appendix that were nice to have. I'll put them down here for my own reference:

1. Stick to a sleep schedule. Your brain likes regularly scheduled programming for some reason. iOS has a pretty good "Bedtime" feature that I use.
2. Don't exercise too close to your scheduled bedtime. Keep a 2 to 3 hour padding in there.
3. Avoid caffiene and nicotine, either one will mess up your sleep schedule. I imagine mixing them together would also be bad. There's around an eight hour cooldown on these, so I just avoid drinking coffee after noon.
4. Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed - they mess up your REM cycle, and can tend to wake you up in the middle of the night. Day drinkers had it right all along.
5. Avoid large meals and drinking a lot of liquids before bed.
6. Avoid medication that delay or disrupt sleep.
7. No naps after 15:00.
8. Relax before bed. Read a book. Probably not this one.
9. Taking a hot bath before you go to bed can help you go to sleep. There's the clear effect of relaxation, if you're not Bill Burr, and a drop in body temperature can help you feel sleepy (though I'm not sure why - maybe it's because your body drops in temperature when you sleep and your brain maps that to an increase in melatonin).
10. Make your bedroom a temple for sleep. Remove gadgets if you can, keep it cool, and turn your clock's face out of view if you get anxious about falling asleep by `x` time.
11. Have the right sunlight exposure throughout the day. If you can, wake up with the sun. Failing that, keep bright lights on in the morning. Then, when you're getting close to bedtime, turn the lights down.
12. This one was *key* for me. Don't lie in bed awake. It's not doing anything, except probably delaying your sleep more by making you anxious about why you're not able to fall asleep. Do something relaxing until you feel sleepy.

**The Scarlet Letter** is the first book I read from *How to Read a Book*'s Reading list.

Maybe I'll do a more detailed writeup of what resonated with me personally in the future.

| The Rosie Project | Graeme Simsion | 3/5 |
| To Kill a Mockingbird | Harper Lee | 5/5 |
| The Da Vinci Code | Dan Brown | 3/5 |
| How to Read a Book | Charles Van Doren; Mortimer J. Adler | 5/5 |

**The Rosie project** comes recommended highly by Bill Gates. It's a fun read that tries to point out that you can't always look at life's challenges as something that can be "figured out" or "optimized". Hard work will take you places, but sometimes luck and unpredictable events will send you off course to elsewhere. See the [Gates Notes post](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Rosie-Project) (Also see his recommendations in general [here](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books)).

**To Kill a Mockingbird** was on my "American classics that practically everyone is forced to read in high school but I somehow wasn't" list. An easy-to-read but important story about a man who follows his conscience despite it being unpopular, difficult, and even dangerous, told through the eyes of his children. Themes of prejudice and gradual societal change are prominent.

**The Da Vinci Code** is a mystery thriller that puts readers through fictional actions used to uncover the truth behind an actual conspiracy theory. It lends from existing materials (e.g. New Testament, Da Vinci artwork, Paganism) to make arguments for the theory whilst the characters uncover it. I remember it being somewhat controversial back when I was in high-school, leading to some sort of [Streissand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect) taking place. I'm happy to hear that some Catholic groups have taken to using the material in *The Da Vinci Code* as a launching point for conversation rather than marking it as verboten, which is rarely, if ever, a good idea.

I groaned through some of the symbological analysis by the protagonist and his compatriots, but kept reading because I'm an absolute sucker for any sort of conspiracy/mystery plot above the grade of *Scooby-Doo*. It's fairly annoying to read this for information given the blend of hard facts and logical leaps, and if you're looking for a history (critical or otherwise) of the Catholic church, definitely continue your reading elsewhere.

**How to Read a Book** is a practical book that lays out how you should go about reading non-fiction books that deserve your full attention and focus, and in doing so, works towards convincing you that *actively* reading books is worth doing, and worth doing well. Many of the pointers are easy to guess at, even though it's rare to see them employed; reading the table of contents, categorizing a book as narrowly as possible, laying out the author's arguments before diving into them - these are all practices that, with practice and proper application, will save you from reading good books without comprehending them (i.e. becoming simultaneously widely and poorly read). It should also save you from reading poorly-written books almost entirely.

A high-level overview is available [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_a_Book). That being said, I highly encourage you to buy your own copy, along with a highlighter, and get to work on reading it cover to cover.

I look forward to reading some of the [suggested books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_a_Book#Reading_list_(1972_edition)) in 2020.

| It  | Stephen King | 5/5  |

I really enjoyed *It*. It's a pretty long book to read through, but the length is justified and applied to the right areas. Stephen King excels in developing characters development and building relationships between them when he's at his best.

I watched the movies as well, and they were pretty good, given the constraints of the medium - some of the scenes have to change (or be swapped out entirely) because you can't convey psychological terror all that well on the silver screen. By only watching the movies, you do miss out on quite a bit of detail. The things I missed the most:

- Slower pacing.
- Secondary antagonist development. Beverly's father, the Bowers (father and son), and Patrick H. were all much more compelling in the book. I think the movies could have done better by Henry Bowers, especially.
- Bonds between the protagonists. I get that the movie can't cover all of the adventures and shenanigans The Losers Club got into, but even the ones that were included didn't hit home for me.
- The discovery and recounting of the history of Derry, Maine. An understandable exclusion, but really hurt Mike Hanlon's character.
- General Stephen King weirdness and more serious adult themes.

In short, the movie doesn't capture the true spirit of the book, but I don't know that I really expected it to.

I've heard that the ending was controversial (see earlier reference to "general Stephen King weirdness"), but I think it worked OK, and the movie did a good job of altering it, or rather completely changing it, to something that worked for a wider audience. Even as a person that was left **very** salty about the end of the Dark Tower series, I think the book's ending was fine. I'll admit that I kind of sped through it, because part of me figures that's what Stephen King did when he wrote it. Note that I don't say that as an attack on his writing, but as an understanding that he focuses on the journey rather than the destination. King adds endings to his stories because they're required to make them coherent, but I don't get the impression that he enjoys the process of it.

Highly recommend. Don't feel that you'll be wasting your time reading the book if you've seen the movies. It's not just a matter of deleted scenes; it's a matter of having a wide spread of characters that are excellently and deeply developed in a way no movie of a reasonable length can ever hope to accomplish.

Many of these do not have ratings. I think it's been too long since I've read some of them to provide a fair one.
