| The Stand | Stephen King | 3/5 |

**The Stand** was pitched to me as one of Stephen King's most popular books. Generally speaking, constant readers of King either like *It* or *The Stand* the most. Neither of these are King's own favorite - that title goes to *Lisey's Story*, a book I have not read.

The book starts off strongly with a pretty wide cast of characters. There's Franny Goldsmith, Stuart Redman, a newly hired deaf-mute deputy, some guys on an army base, a mentally deranged arsonist that goes by "Trashcan Man", and even more where that came from. It's a pretty large ensemble of varied characters that lovers of *It* would probably take as a good sign, since *It* did a really good job of taking sets of disjoint characters and throwing them all into a ring together.

That's why this book fell a little flat for me - the characters, so good alone, were never built into something that was better than the sum of their parts, or even equal to it. Characters that were much stronger on their own, such as Fran and Stuart, were both less interesting once they met. Stuart went from being a stoic man of quiet strength to being a stock male character that acted predictably. Fran went from being an independent woman that was going to carve her own way in the world to becoming a doting wife. I'm not saying that the characters act irrationally, or that there's anything wrong with the people they become in principle. It just means they're not terribly interesting to listen to, even if they're endangering their life or acting selflessly. It's especially disappointing since the characters had real promise earlier on in the book. *It* did not have this problem - to my recollection, every character had a solid trajectory throughout the span of that book.

Pretty disappointed in how the R.F. side of the story concluded, too. Stephen King knows how to write a villain cloaked in shadow *very* well. He shares terrifying details that scare you while simultaneously making you want more. When the story starts asking how this character might meet it's demise, though, Stephen King draws a serious blank. This was actually one of the better villain endings he's written (not as good as *It*'s), but it's still a disappointment. R.F.'s defeat isn't surprising or all that interesting, but the character himself *was*. That disparity is why I feel disappointed.

Overly long with some disappointing characters. Worth a read, but if you're looking for my favorite Stephen King book, this isn't it. He's written better stories in fewer pages.

## May

Listen, **The Stand** is a long book. Such a long book. Then, Stephen King said, "Hey, you know that long book I wrote? Yeah, let's make it longer and publish it again."

Also Reading **Black Wave**, but not commenting on it until I finish. It's a hard read given how unfamiliar I am with ~~Middle-Eastern names, geography, culture, history~~ the Middle-East.

| Never Split the Difference | Chris Voss | 4/5 |

**Never Split the Difference** is a practical book on negotiation told by a man that has experience in high-stake negotiations where lives hang in the balance. It's a little odd to take that one-line summary at first glance and come away convinced that this will help you in negotiating mundane things that are a part of your every day life, like rent or a paycheck.

The book is interesting in that it doesn't focus on game theory or intellectual arguments much at all. The keystone of the methods put forward by Voss is actually emotional intelligence (Voss coins the phrase "tactical empathy", which is actually kind of hilarious). He thinks that what his experience has taught him most is that a lot of kidnappers, bank robbers, and other would-be action movie characters don't barter using strong logic, not exclusively anyway, and neither does the average person on the street.

He encourages empathizing with the people you're negotiating with, to call them generous and to keep your "late night FM DJ" voice on at all times. Ask open-ended questions and make them solve your problems ("How am I supposed to pay $X for this when this less expensive alternative is right in front of me?", "How am I supposed to do that?") while being as earnest, calm, and reasonable as you can manage to be - you and your counterpart are working together toward a solution. It's a pretty moral system if you approach it with the right mindset, or a pretty amoral one if you're a sociopath (sort of like "How to Win Friends and Influence People").

| Why We Sleep | Matthew Walker, PhD | 3/5 |

**Why We Sleep** probably isn't a book you should bother reading cover-to-cover. Really, if you already know that sleep is good for you and that missing sleep is bad, you can probably do without it entirely. There's some interesting trivia about the stages of sleep and how its qualities might change from, say, childhood to adulthood, but nothing revolutionary. If you don't value sleep, this book might work as a "scared straight" sort of experience, because it turns out that this neuroscientist is pretty confident that missing sleep'll mess you up.

There were 12 tips in the appendix that were nice to have. I'll put them down here for my own reference:

1. Stick to a sleep schedule. Your brain likes regularly scheduled programming for some reason. iOS has a pretty good "Bedtime" feature that I use.
2. Don't exercise too close to your scheduled bedtime. Keep a 2 to 3 hour padding in there.
3. Avoid caffiene and nicotine, either one will mess up your sleep schedule. I imagine mixing them together would also be bad. There's around an eight hour cooldown on these, so I just avoid drinking coffee after noon.
4. Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed - they mess up your REM cycle, and can tend to wake you up in the middle of the night. Day drinkers had it right all along.
5. Avoid large meals and drinking a lot of liquids before bed.
6. Avoid medication that delay or disrupt sleep.
7. No naps after 15:00.
8. Relax before bed. Read a book. Probably not this one.
9. Taking a hot bath before you go to bed can help you go to sleep. There's the clear effect of relaxation, if you're not Bill Burr, and a drop in body temperature can help you feel sleepy (though I'm not sure why - maybe it's because your body drops in temperature when you sleep and your brain maps that to an increase in melatonin).
10. Make your bedroom a temple for sleep. Remove gadgets if you can, keep it cool, and turn your clock's face out of view if you get anxious about falling asleep by `x` time.
11. Have the right sunlight exposure throughout the day. If you can, wake up with the sun. Failing that, keep bright lights on in the morning. Then, when you're getting close to bedtime, turn the lights down.
12. This one was *key* for me. Don't lie in bed awake. It's not doing anything, except probably delaying your sleep more by making you anxious about why you're not able to fall asleep. Do something relaxing until you feel sleepy.

| The Scarlet Letter | Nathaniel Hathaway | 5/5 |

**The Scarlet Letter** is the first book I read from *How to Read a Book*'s Reading list. It's a different style of fiction than I'm used to - descriptions of emotion and imagery go into a great amount of detail, told beautifully. Maybe I'll do a more detailed writeup of what resonated with me personally in the future.

## January

No books read. I blame *Sapiens* - I disliked this book quite a bit and it made me slow down quite a bit as a result. Never did finish it.

| The Rosie Project | Graeme Simsion | 3/5 |
| To Kill a Mockingbird | Harper Lee | 5/5 |
| The Da Vinci Code | Dan Brown | 3/5 |
| How to Read a Book | Charles Van Doren; Mortimer J. Adler | 5/5 |

**The Rosie project** comes recommended highly by Bill Gates. It's a fun read that tries to point out that you can't always look at life's challenges as something that can be "figured out" or "optimized". Hard work will take you places, but sometimes luck and unpredictable events will send you off course to elsewhere. See the [Gates Notes post](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Rosie-Project) (Also see his recommendations in general [here](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books)).

**To Kill a Mockingbird** was on my "American classics that practically everyone is forced to read in high school but I somehow wasn't" list. An easy-to-read but important story about a man who follows his conscience despite it being unpopular, difficult, and even dangerous, told through the eyes of his children. Themes of prejudice and gradual societal change are prominent.

**The Da Vinci Code** is a mystery thriller that puts readers through fictional actions used to uncover the truth behind an actual conspiracy theory. It lends from existing materials (e.g. New Testament, Da Vinci artwork, Paganism) to make arguments for the theory whilst the characters uncover it. I remember it being somewhat controversial back when I was in high-school, leading to some sort of [Streissand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect) taking place. I'm happy to hear that some Catholic groups have taken to using the material in *The Da Vinci Code* as a launching point for conversation rather than marking it as verboten, which is rarely, if ever, a good idea.

I groaned through some of the symbological analysis by the protagonist and his compatriots, but kept reading because I'm an absolute sucker for any sort of conspiracy/mystery plot above the grade of *Scooby-Doo*. It's fairly annoying to read this for information given the blend of hard facts and logical leaps, and if you're looking for a history (critical or otherwise) of the Catholic church, definitely continue your reading elsewhere.

**How to Read a Book** is a practical book that lays out how you should go about reading non-fiction books that deserve your full attention and focus, and in doing so, works towards convincing you that *actively* reading books is worth doing, and worth doing well. Many of the pointers are easy to guess at, even though it's rare to see them employed; reading the table of contents, categorizing a book as narrowly as possible, laying out the author's arguments before diving into them - these are all practices that, with practice and proper application, will save you from reading good books without comprehending them (i.e. becoming simultaneously widely and poorly read). It should also save you from reading poorly-written books almost entirely.

A high-level overview is available [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_a_Book). That being said, I highly encourage you to buy your own copy, along with a highlighter, and get to work on reading it cover to cover.

I look forward to reading some of the [suggested books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_a_Book#Reading_list_(1972_edition)) in 2020.

| It  | Stephen King | 5/5  |

I really enjoyed *It*. It's a pretty long book to read through, but the length is justified and applied to the right areas. Stephen King excels in developing characters development and building relationships between them when he's at his best.

I watched the movies as well, and they were pretty good, given the constraints of the medium - some of the scenes have to change (or be swapped out entirely) because you can't convey psychological terror all that well on the silver screen. By only watching the movies, you do miss out on quite a bit of detail. The things I missed the most:

- Slower pacing.
- Secondary antagonist development. Beverly's father, the Bowers (father and son), and Patrick H. were all much more compelling in the book. I think the movies could have done better by Henry Bowers, especially.
- Bonds between the protagonists. I get that the movie can't cover all of the adventures and shenanigans The Losers Club got into, but even the ones that were included didn't hit home for me.
- The discovery and recounting of the history of Derry, Maine. An understandable exclusion, but really hurt Mike Hanlon's character.
- General Stephen King weirdness and more serious adult themes.

In short, the movie doesn't capture the true spirit of the book, but I don't know that I really expected it to.

I've heard that the ending was controversial (see earlier reference to "general Stephen King weirdness"), but I think it worked OK, and the movie did a good job of altering it, or rather completely changing it, to something that worked for a wider audience. Even as a person that was left **very** salty about the end of the Dark Tower series, I think the book's ending was fine. I'll admit that I kind of sped through it, because part of me figures that's what Stephen King did when he wrote it. Note that I don't say that as an attack on his writing, but as an understanding that he focuses on the journey rather than the destination. King adds endings to his stories because they're required to make them coherent, but I don't get the impression that he enjoys the process of it.

Highly recommend. Don't feel that you'll be wasting your time reading the book if you've seen the movies. It's not just a matter of deleted scenes; it's a matter of having a wide spread of characters that are excellently and deeply developed in a way no movie of a reasonable length can ever hope to accomplish.
