It's been a while since I've hiked. The winters in Seattle are pretty mild, but the weather is typically
rainy, and a lot of the more difficult hikes get a bit more difficult still.

The initial plan was to head back to Illinor. Although I've finished the trail before, it's a great place
to take people who aren't from the area to; it showcases some of the great natural features the PNW has to
offer, and you can never get tired of the views on display there. However, the snowfield was expecting a good
extra 10 inches of snow the day before (on top of what had accumulated over the winter), and neither I nor my
hiking partner had snowshoes, so we decided to put it off for another day.

We decided to head to [Poo Poo Point Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/poo-poo-point-trail) (writing that name feels ridiculous even now) instead. It's rated as moderately intense at a length of 6.7 miles and an elevation gain of over 2000 feet, and gave me a good chance to
try out some recently-purchased hiking boots without risk of too much discomfort. The trail was clearly maintained, pretty well-trafficked,
and consistently upward sloping. That being said, it wasn't particularly unique or feature-filled - it's just a path to a peak.

The weather conditions weren't in our favor - there was a fair bit of rain and a gusty wind. We were prepared for the
breezes, but it was a reason to be glad that we weren't on Illinor, which I found to be plenty challenging even on an ideal summer day.
The trail was pretty easy to finish, and somewhat briefer than I had expected. We arrived at the top to find a takeoff zone
for gliders. I hadn't known this before going on the trail, but Poo Poo Point is a pretty popular place for them to take off, and it's
no surprise. It's close to residential areas, not too large of a climb, and there are wide open spaces all around the point itself so that
gliders don't need to be overly concerned about where they land.

We were unsure if we'd be able to see very far from the peak - as I mentioned before, rain clouds were passing through, and it wouldn't have surprised me
if fog had covered a lot of the area around us. Fortunately, we were able to see for miles around us, giving us great views of Lake Sammamish as we
readied ourselves for the descent.
