# Hello!

I am a Software Development Engineer at AWS SageMaker and an alumnus of The Ohio State University's Computer Science and Engineering Program.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing piano, riding my bike, writing, and learning about new things. Some of these things will end up documented here, but it's mostly a glorified resume and reading list.

Feel free to get in touch - contact information is at the bottom of the page. Anything sent by a human is welcome :)
