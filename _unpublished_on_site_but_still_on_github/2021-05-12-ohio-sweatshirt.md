I wear a hoodie that says "Ohio" on it a lot. It results in a lot of conversations with strangers, which is one of the reasons I like wearing it.

## "There are billboards in Seattle telling me to move to Ohio"

I've never noticed these myself, but sure enough [they exist](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/snow-ridden-ohio-plays-off-seattles-rainy-weather-clever-ad-campaign-attract-jobs/). They pitch Ohio as having a lower cost of living, making it a great place for permanent remote work-from-home location. Another version of the billboard talks about Ohio's aerospace industry, probably aiming to attract Boeing engineers over to GE Aviation or to the Air Force base in Dayton. Most people that bring this up to me seem sort of skeptical that it'll work, but like most economic exercises, it's about catching the folks on the margin.

Where the tech industry is concerned, Ohio doesn't have a lot of local supply, and the jobs that do exist out there don't compare well to the jobs you can get in Seattle with respect to salary and benefits. Ohio also has income tax, whereas Washington State does not (and working remotely for an out-of-state company won't save you from them).

Then there's the geography - Seattle has an upper hand there. Oceans, mountains, glaciers, volcanoes, and more are all a pretty close drive. It's hard to price it, and even if you don't get up much, you still see a lot of beautiful scenery incidentally around Seattle and Washington State as a whole.

Cultural differences are pretty wide between the two, but much more difficult to build a moving decision around if you haven't spent a lot of time in both locations. In my opinion, you feel a bigger sense of community in Ohio, but I'm biased.

## "Hey, you're from Ohio? You know that song by The Pretenders? It used to play before Rush Limbaugh's show."

I didn't realize it, but I do, and I'm pretty sure for the exact reason that it used to play before Rush Limbuagh's radio show when I was a kid walking around our house. The AM radio was usually set to one of a few stations, and over the years it got drilled into my head.

[My City Was Gone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_City_Was_Gone)

> I went back to Ohio
> But my city was gone
> There was no train station
> There was no downtown
> 
> South Howard had disappeared
> All my favorite places
> My city had been pulled down
> Reduced to parking spaces
> Ay, oh, way to go, Ohio
> 
> Well, I went back to Ohio
> But my family was gone
> I stood on the back porch
> There was nobody home
> 
> I was stunned and amazed
> My childhood memories
> Slowly swirled past
> Like the wind through the trees
> Ay, oh, way to go, Ohio
> 
> I went back to Ohio
> But my pretty countryside
> Had been paved down the middle
> By a government that had no pride
> 
> The farms of Ohio
> Had been replaced by shopping malls
> And Muzak filled the air
> From Seneca to Cuyahoga Falls
> Said, ay, oh, way to go, Ohio
