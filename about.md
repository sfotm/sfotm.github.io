title: About me 
---

 I am a proud Software Development Engineer at Amazon.com and an alumnus of The Ohio State University's Computer Science and Engineering Program. I believe that through creating intuitive and powerful software, developers will take a large part in creating the world of tomorrow.

In my free time, I like to develop games, mobile apps, and other things. When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me kayaking, exercising, or hiking.

I'm also a big proponent of self-hosted and open source software.
